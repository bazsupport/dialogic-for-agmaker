# Dialogic 2 For AGMaker

This is a modified version of Dialogic 2 that includes seamless integration with Action Game Maker, making it easy for non-programmers to add professional dialogue systems to their games without coding.

## What kind of AGMaker Integration?

The AGMaker integration allows you to trigger Dialogic conversations directly from your Action Game Maker visual scripts using simple signal emissions. No complex coding required!

## Quick Start for AGMaker Users

### üì¶ Installation

1. **Download the Plugin**
   - Add the `dialogic` folder to your project's `addons` folder
   - If you don't have an `addons` folder, create one in your project root
   
2. **Enable the Plugin**
   - Go to **Project Settings** ‚Üí **Plugins**
   - Find "Dialogic" and enable it
   - **Important:** Reload your editor after enabling

3. **Setup Complete!** ‚úÖ

### üîß Basic Usage

#### Step 1: Create Your Dialogue Timeline
First, you'll need to create your dialogue content using Dialogic's timeline editor:
- Open the Dialogic dock in Godot
- Create a new timeline and give it a memorable name (e.g., "ShopKeeper_Greeting")
- Add your dialogue, characters, and choices
- For detailed timeline creation, see the [Official Dialogic Documentation](https://docs.dialogic.pro/)

#### Step 2: Add the BazDialogicLink Node
1. In your scene, add a new node ‚Üí **BazDialogicLink**
2. Configure the node properties:
   - **Game Object is Owner**: Usually keep this checked (uses the object with your visual script)
   - **Timeline Name**: Enter the exact name of your Dialogic timeline. Additionally, you can choose to rename the node and use that as the timeline name

#### Step 3: Connect from a Visual Script
1. In your AGMaker visual script, add an **EmitSignal** action
2. Use the **exact same name** as your timeline name for the signal

#### Step 4: Handle Dialogue Completion (Optional)
If you want your game to wait until the dialogue finishes:
1. Add a **SignalDetected** condition in the link leaving your dialogue trigger state
2. Use `timeline_ended` as the signal name
3. This prevents the state from continuing until the player finishes reading

#### Step 5: Handle Player Choices (Optional)
When your dialogue includes choices, you can respond to player selections:
1. Add a **SignalDetected** condition after your dialogue trigger
2. Use `timeline_choice` as the signal name
3. The signal will include the choice number (starting from 0) as a parameter
4. Use **GetSignalParameter** to retrieve the choice number
5. Create branching logic based on the choice value

**Example Choice Handling:**
- Choice 0: "Yes" ‚Üí Continue to acceptance dialogue
- Choice 1: "No" ‚Üí Continue to rejection dialogue
- Choice 2: "Maybe later" ‚Üí End conversation

### üîÑ Multiple Dialogues Per Object

You can have multiple conversations on the same object:
- Add multiple BazDialogicLink nodes
- Give each a different timeline name
- EmitSignal different signals for different conversations

### üìù Important Notes

- **Signal Names Must Match**: The signal you emit must exactly match your timeline name
- **One Node Per Timeline**: Each BazDialogicLink handles one timeline
- **Case Sensitive**: Timeline names are case-sensitive
- **No Spaces**: Avoid spaces in timeline names (use underscores instead)
- **Choice Numbers**: Choices are numbered starting from 0 (first choice = 0, second choice = 1, etc.)

### üÜò Troubleshooting

**Dialogue Not Starting?**
- Check signal name matches timeline name exactly
- Ensure BazDialogicLink node is in the scene
- Verify timeline exists in Dialogic

**Game Not Waiting for Dialogue?**
- Make sure you're using "timeline_ended" signal detection
- Check the signal is spelled correctly (no capital letters)
- Consider saving a SignalDetected resource with the timeline_ended already typed in for ease of use

**Choices Not Working?**
- Ensure your timeline has choice events in Dialogic
- Use "timeline_choice" signal detection after dialogue starts
- Check that GetSignalParameter is correctly retrieving the choice number
- Remember choice numbers start from 0, not 1

### üìö Next Steps

Once you've got basic dialogues working:
- Explore character portraits and animations in Dialogic
- Try branching conversations with choices and use the choice handling system
- Add variables to track player decisions across multiple conversations
- Check out the full Dialogic documentation below for advanced features

## Version

Dialogic 2 **requires at least Godot 4.2**.

[If you are looking for the Godot 3.x version (Dialogic 1.x) you can find it here.](https://github.com/dialogic-godot/dialogic-1)

## Installation
Follow the installation instructions on our [Getting Started](https://docs.dialogic.pro/getting-started.html#1-installation--activation) documentation.

Dialogic comes with an auto-updater so you can install future versions right from within the plugin.

## Documentation
You can find the official documentation of Dialogic here: [Dialogic Documentation](https://docs.dialogic.pro/)

There is a Class Reference as well: [Class Reference](https://docs.dialogic.pro/class_index.html)


## Connect with us!
If you need help or want to share your Dialogic projects, take a look at the following options:

- Ask questions, or report bugs on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DjcDgDaTMe)
- Report bugs and issues on the [GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/dialogic-godot/dialogic/issues)
- Ask questions on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dialogic-godot/dialogic/discussions)

## Testing
Dialogic uses [Unit Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) to ensure specific parts function as expected. These tests run on every git push and pull request. The framework to do these tests is called [gdUnit4](https://github.com/MikeSchulze/gdUnit4) and our tests reside in the [/Tests/Unit](https://github.com/dialogic-godot/dialogic/tree/main/Tests/Unit) path. We recommend installing the `gdUnit4` add-on from the `AssetLib`, with this add-on, you can run tests locally.

To get started, take a look at the existing files in the path and read the documentation to [create your first test](https://mikeschulze.github.io/gdUnit4/first_steps/firstTest/).

## Interacting with the Source Code
All methods and variables in the Dialogic 2 source **code prefixed with an underscore (`_`)** are considered *private*, for instance: `_remove_character()`.

While you can use them, they may change in their behavior or change their signature, causing breakage in your code while moving between versions.
Most private methods are used inside public ones; if you need help, check the documentation.

**Public methods and variables can be found in our [Class Reference](https://docs.dialogic.pro/class_index.html).**

During the Alpha and Beta version stages, code may change at any Dialogic Release to allow drafting a better design.
Changelogs will accommodate for these changes and inform you on how to update your code.
