# Ignore everything
*

# But not these files/folders
!.gitignore
!addons/
!addons/**

# Godot 4+ specific ignores
.godot/
Thought Process

I've proposed changes to your .gitignore file that will ensure only the addons folder gets tracked by git. Here's how it works:

# Ignore everything and * - This tells git to ignore all files and folders by default
!.gitignore - This makes an exception for the .gitignore file itself, so it can be committed
!addons/ - This adds an exception for the addons folder
!addons/** - This adds an exception for everything inside the addons folder (all subfolders and files)
The original Godot-specific ignore for the .godot/ folder is kept
With these changes, git will only track:

The .gitignore file itself
The addons folder and all its contents
Everything else in your repository will be ignored. You can apply these changes to implement this setup.
